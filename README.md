Base Robot

> Contains bootstrap code for a robot.

This project only contains a simple Robot class and everything needed to deploy to the robot. It is the equivalent of a fresh robot project from which baby robot projects can be spawned.
 
### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Use **Import from GitHub** in IntelliJ IDEA to clone your fork.
